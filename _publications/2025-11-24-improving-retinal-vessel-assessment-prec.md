> **TL;DR:** A hybrid system that combines deep learning vessel segmentation with interactive editing and graphical modeling to achieve more precise retinal vessel assessment than either approach alone.

## What this paper is about

Accurate retinal vessel assessment is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring eye diseases, but purely automatic deep learning segmentation still makes errors -- especially on fine vessels or in pathological regions. Meanwhile, fully manual assessment is too time-consuming for clinical practice.

## Key idea

The paper integrates deep learning-based vessel segmentation with an interactive editing interface and graphical modeling, allowing clinicians to efficiently correct segmentation errors while the graphical model ensures topological consistency of the vessel tree. This human-in-the-loop approach gets the best of both worlds.

## Why it matters

Published in Scientific Reports, this work offers a practical clinical tool that balances automation with expert oversight, directly improving the reliability of retinal vessel measurements used in ophthalmic diagnosis.
